## Overview of Project

### Purpose
 Fundraising is no easy task. Many different variables can affect the outcome of a fundraiser. Data from successful and failed campaigns can guide us through the challenges of a fundraiser. By analyzing trends of past campaigns, we will be able to make data-based decisions, increasing the chances of success.For this analysis, I used data from a sample of 4113 different fundraisers. The data was sorted and filtered to meet our client’s needs.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For this analysis, I used data from a sample of 4113 different fundraisers. The data was sorted and filtered to meet our client’s needs. By using pivot tables, I sorted the data and created a linear graph based on the launch date. I performed this analysis to identify the relation between the launch date and the outcomes of the campaigns.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

This analysis suggests that there is a significant association between the launch dates and their outcomes. The chart indicates that a campaign launched in May, June, or July has a greater success rate than the rest of the months. The data suggest that a campaign launched in December has a 43% chance of failure.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

This analysis suggests that a campaign with a goal of less than $1000 and no more than $5000 has a high success rate of 73%-76%. The graph also reveals that a campaign with a goal of $50000 or more has a fail rate of 83%.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There are several limitations to the models above. While this model shows a significant association with the outcome and the month it launched, it doesn’t consider how long the fundraiser was running. It also doesn’t take into consideration where the fundraisers have taken place.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

I would recommend having a different graph with different Categories of fundraisers to identify if the same trend of success happens in the same months as the theater category.
