## Overview of Project

### Purpose
 Fundraising is no easy task. Many different variables can affect the outcome of a fundraiser. Data from successful and failed campaigns can guide us through the challenges of a fundraiser. By analyzing trends of past campaigns, we will be able to make data-based decisions, increasing the chances of success.For this analysis, I used data from a sample of 4113 different fundraisers. The data was sorted and filtered to meet our clientâ€™s needs.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using pivot tables, I sorted the data and created a linear graph based on the launch date. I performed this analysis to identify the relation between the launch date and the outcomes of the campaigns. I created a linear graph to see the direct relationship between the two (launch dates and outcomes).  This analysis suggests that there is a significant association between the launch dates and their outcomes. The chart indicates that a campaign launched in May, June, or July has a greater success rate than the rest of the months. The data suggest that a campaign launched in December has a 43% chance of failure.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
